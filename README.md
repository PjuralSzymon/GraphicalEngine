# Graphical Engine in C# Readme

## Overview
This graphical engine, developed entirely from scratch in C#, provides a foundation for rendering basic scenes. The project is organized into several key folders:

- **Algorithms**: Contains various algorithms, including the implementation of the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.
- **Components**: Houses fundamental components such as lines, triangles, and meshes. Noteworthy features include options for stable calculations for improved performance.
- **Engine**: Core components of the engine, including the main `GameEngine` class, responsible for managing viewports, scenes, and updates.
- **GameObject**: Defines game objects, such as those used for lighting animations.
- **Scenes**: Represents different scenes, demonstrating the engine's capability to render various environments.

## Project Structure

- **Algorithms**: Houses algorithms crucial for efficient graphics rendering.
- **Components**: Contains reusable building blocks for graphics, including lines, triangles, and meshes.
- **Engine**: Centralized location for the core engine functionality, encompassing the `GameEngine` class.
- **GameObject**: Defines specific objects used within the game, with a focus on elements like lighting animations.
- **Scenes**: Organizes scenes to showcase the engine's versatility in rendering different environments.

## Key Features

- **Line Clipping**: Implements the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm for efficient rendering.
- **Flexible Components**: The `Components` folder provides a range of components, from basic lines to more complex mesh structures.
- **Scene Management**: Demonstrates the ability to manage and render different scenes with varying environments.
